### From the Duckett JS book:
#### Ch. 10,(226-246) “Error Handling & Debugging”
When you are writing JavaScript, do not expect to write it perfectly the first time. Programming is like problem solving: 
you are given a puzzle and not only do you have to solve it, but you also need to create the instructions that allow the computer to solve it. too.
When writing a long script, nobody gets everything right in their first attempt. The error messages that a browser gives look cryptic at first, 
but they can help you determine what went wrong in your JavaScript and how to fix it.
  You may remember from pages 185-186 that in there is a difference between block leveland inline elements and how browsers display them. 
  Block level elements look like they start on a new line. 
Examples include the <h1>- <h6>, <p> and <div> elements. 
  Inline elements flow within the text and do not start on a new line. 
Examples include <b>, <i>, <img>, <em> and <span>.
 
The <link> element can be used in an HTML document to tell the browser where to find the CSS file used to style the page. It is an
empty element (meaning it does not need a closing tag), and it lives inside the <head> element. It should use three attributes:
  href 
This specifies the path to the CSS file (which is often placed in a folder called css or styles). 
  type
This attribute specifies the type of document being linked to. The value should be text/css.
rel
This specifies the relationship between the HTML page and the file it is linked to. The value should be stylesheet when
linking to a CSS file. An HTML page can use more than one CSS style sheet. To do this it could have a <link> element for every CSS file it uses. 
For example, some authors use one CSS file to control the presentation (such as fonts and colors) and a second to control the layout.
 You can also include CSS rules within an HTML page by placing them inside a <style> element, which usually sits inside the <head> element of the page.
The <style> element should use the type attribute to indicate that the styles are specified in CSS. The value should be text/ css.
CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.
 Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like). Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.
 Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties. For example, the font-family property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
 CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page.

1. so you have extra eyes.
2. so you have extra hands.
3. so you have extra brains.
4. so theres a higher statistical chance you'll have some "sense" between the two assumed huemans.
