Go through these resources, and create a page in your reading-notes repo that summarizes 
what you learned as though you were presenting the material to a non-technical friend interested 
in learning about it.

Reading-notes entry ideas:

Blog Article (2-3 paragraphs with code sample)

Choosing a Text Editor

heres a quote from a dude:  "don’t think that it truly matters as to which text editor you use. Yes,

there are several google it. 

Document in your reading-notes the different classifications of text editors, and why it’s 
important for software developers to be thoughtful about their selection of what they use to 
write code.
