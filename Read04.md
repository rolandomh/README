### From the Duckett HTML book:
### Chapter 4: Ch.4 “Links” (pp.74-93)
Links are created using the  X<a>  element.The  
<a>  element uses the href  attribute to indicate the page you are linking to. If you are linking to a page within your own site, 
it's best to use relative links rather than qualiﬁed URLs. You can create links to open email programs with an email address in the "to" ﬁeld.You can use the 
id  attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to.
'target' command IS pop-up.To link to a ﬁle in the sa me folder, just use the ﬁle name. (Nothing else is n eeded.)
For a child folder, use the name of the child folder, followed by a forward slash, then the ﬁle name. Use the name of the child folder, followed by a for ward slash, 
then the name of the grand child folder, followed by another for ward slash, then the ﬁle name.
Use .. /  to ind icate the folder above the current one, then follow it with the ﬁle name. Repeat the .. /  to indicate that you want to go up two folders (rather than one),
then follow it with the ﬁle name.
