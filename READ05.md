### Reading05
### From the Duckett HTML book:
### Chapter 5: “Images” (pp.94-125)

#####Remember that all images are subject to copyright, and you can get in trouble for simply taking photographs from another website. 
How to add images to pages
![Type-copy](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_img.asp)
Be relevant       
Convey information       
Convey the right mood        
Be instantly recognisable        
Fit the color palette
Choose the right format 
Optimize images for the web

###Chapter 11: “Color” (pp.246-263)
*RGB COLORS*
These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up. 
example: rgb(100, 100, 90)
*HEX COLORS*
These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash # sign. 
example: #ee3e80
*COLOR NAMES*
There are 147 predeﬁned color names that are recognized by browsers.
example: DarkCyan

###Chapter 12: “Text” (pp.264-299)
*Serif fonts*
have extra details on the ends of the main strokes of the letters. These details are known as serifs. In print, 
serif fonts were traditionally used for long passages of text because they were considered easier to read.  
*Sans-serif fonts* 
have straight ends to letters, and therefore have a much cleaner design. Screens have a lower resolution than print. 
So, if the text is small, sans-serif fonts can be clearer to read.
*MONO-SPACE*
Every letter in a monospace (or ﬁxed-width) font is the same width. (Non-monospace fonts have different widths.)
