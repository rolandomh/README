  //take this code ro Replit for results.
  The  < t a bl e >  element is used to add tables to a web page .A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created with the <tr>  element.
  Inside each row there are a number of cells represented by the <td>  element (or <th> if it is a header).
  You can make cells of a table span more than one row or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.
  For long tables you can split the table into a <t head>, <t body>, and <t foot>.
