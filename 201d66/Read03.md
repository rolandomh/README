###From the Duckett HTML book:
###Chapter 3: “Lists” (pp.62-73)
* Type-copy direct from hardcopy:
There are three types of HTML lists: ordered, unordered, and definition.Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is numbered. 
For example, the list might be a set of steps for a recipe that must be performed in order, 
or a legal contract where each point needs to be identified by a section number.
* Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point (rather than characters that indicate order).
* Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.
* <ol> The ordered list is created with the <ol> element.
* <li> Each item in the list is placed between an opening <li> tag and a closing </li> tag. (The li stands for list item.)
* <ul> The unordered list is created with the <ul> element.
* <li> Each item in the list is placed between an opening <li> tag and a closing </li> tag. (The li stands for list item.)
* You can put a second list inside an <li> element to create a sublist or nested list.

##### X Ordered lists use numbers.
##### X Unordered lists use bullets.
##### X Definition lists are used to define terminology.
##### X Lists can be nested inside one another

###Chapter 13: “Boxes” (pp.300-329)
###From the Duckett JS book: 
At the beginning of this section on CSS, you saw how CSS treats each HTML element as if it lives in its own box.

##### The min-width proper tyspeciﬁes the smallest size a box can be displayed at when the browser window is narrow, 
##### and the max-width property indicates the maximum width a box can stretch to when the browser window is wide

p.one {border-style: solid;}
p.two {border-style: dotted;}
p.three {border-style: dashed;}
p.four {border-style: double;}
p.five {border-style: groove;}
p.six {border-style: ridge;}
p.seven {border-style: inset;}
p.eight {border-style: outset;}

* Dont forget about {text-align: position;}
inline This causes a bock-level element to act like an inline element.block This causes an inline element to act like a block-l evelelement.inline -block 
This causes a block-level element to ﬂow like an inline element, while retaining other features of a block-level element.
You can specify individual values for each corner of a box using :border-top-right-radiusborder-bottom-right-radius border-bottom-left-radiusborder-top-left-radius 
You can also use a shorthand of these four properties (inclockwise order:top, right , bottom, left). 
#### For example:border-radius: 5px, 10 px, 5px, 10px;
X CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box.  
X You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box. 
X You can also control the borders, margin and padding  
X for each box with CSS.It is possible to hide elements using the display and  
X visibility proper ties.Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and  
X inline boxes made into block-level boxes.Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of  
X boxes containing text and the leading.CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image 
X borders and rounded borders

## Review Chapter 2: “Basic JavaScript Instructions” (pp.70-73)
<!-- NOTE! this is how you include itty bitty img INSTEAD of bullet points. -->
## Chapter 4: “Decisions and Loops” from switch statements on (pp.162-182)
