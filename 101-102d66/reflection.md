## reflections on videos and aproaches to code.


after having watched the footage the three items that caught my attention the most are:
the sections speaking to the theory and electrical engineering of the code and the totality of the code being binary at the root.

to further the reality of it is I need more time with the code to get better AT the code. so this schools stacked learning is rad, it only gives me pause at the point where, accomplishment of understanding catch up to my typing.
