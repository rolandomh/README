### Html
#### Html describes the structure of a page. Each word is seen as not syntax alone but maintain their own elemant tags for emphasis. This has visual application with careful linking text can be visually redacted at the structural level not just symantec. An example is on *pg 56*. where the element tag here <del>"content"</del>. would attribute a lne through the text "content". 

#### To further; Understanding CSS as a visual layer, demands we view all content at this level in containers with atributes such as margin, padding allowing the viewer/programmer to see and adjust inline vs block level tags. 

#### Viewing CSS, HTML as style sheets that need to be clearly attached to each other through tags. you have to label it stylesheet. because the book sayeth so...far...To link the stylesheet you have to place the tag <link> in the <head> element.
Lastly, in conjuction to the reading using stylesheets allows you to seperate code layer conversations as to not muddy the code attributes and otherwise readability.
