###From the Duckett HTML book:
###Chapter 3: “Lists” (pp.62-73)
* Type copy direct from hardcopy:
There are three types of HTML lists: ordered, unordered, and definition.Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is numbered. 
For example, the list might be a set of steps for a recipe that must be performed in order, 
or a legal contract where each point needs to be identified by a section number.
* Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point (rather than characters that indicate order).
* Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.
* <ol> The ordered list is created with the <ol> element.
* <li> Each item in the list is placed between an opening <li> tag and a closing </li> tag. (The li stands for list item.)
* <ul> The unordered list is created with the <ul> element.
* <li> Each item in the list is placed between an opening <li> tag and a closing </li> tag. (The li stands for list item.)
* You can put a second list inside an <li> element to create a sublist or nested list.

##### X Ordered lists use numbers.
##### X Unordered lists use bullets.
##### X Definition lists are used to define terminology.
##### X Lists can be nested inside one another

###Chapter 13: “Boxes” (pp.300-329)
###From the Duckett JS book: 
At the beginning of this section on CSS, you saw how CSS treats each HTML element as if it lives in its own box.
